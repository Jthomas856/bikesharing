## Summary
The data shows that there were a total of 2,344,224 trips taken on citibikes in New York City in August 2019. The majority of the rides were taken by male users, with the most popular times being the morning and afternoon commutes to and from work. Majority of citibike users are subscribers, and bikes are typically checked out for 5-20 minute rides (5 minutes being the most popular time). While the NYC citibike data shows that the service is a popular form of transportation in a large metro area, additional analysis would better determine if the service would work in other metros. Additional visualizations for more months in the year, population sizes, and weather data could help to determine if the bikesharing service is a sound investment in other metro areas like Des Moines.
